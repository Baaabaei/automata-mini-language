# automata-mini-language
This code implements a process for constructing a deterministic finite automaton (DFA) from a set of tokens in a miniature programming language. It starts by defining the grammar of the language and providing functions for lexical analysis (tokenization) and creating finite automata for individual tokens. The core functionality lies in the `combine_automata` function, which takes the automata for each token and combines them using the union operation (OR) to create a non-deterministic finite automaton (NFA) that recognizes all the tokens. This NFA is then converted into an equivalent DFA using the subset construction algorithm implemented in the `nfa_to_dfa` function. The resulting DFA can be used for further processing or parsing of the mini language, such as building a parser or a compiler. The code also includes an example usage section that demonstrates the complete process, from tokenizing an input string to constructing and printing the final DFA.
